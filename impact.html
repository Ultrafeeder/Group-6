        <h1 class="h-main">The Situation Now</h1>
        <article class="a-main">While our non-profit organization operates out of North Carolina, a state that offers funding allocations for areas of concentrated povert, these allocations come with certain restrictions, and are only meant to supplement the already low income of an area. Imagine what it must be like in other states that don't even have programs like that, or do, but the income rate in some areas is so low that those programs wouldn't matter? This is the situation we face, and these circumstances perpetuate the cycle of poverty. This cycle is one that can only be ended by those stuck in it, and below are the programs we offer to give students the tools to do just that.</article>

        <article class="a-skill">Basic K-12 education sometimes offers curriculum that includes the hard and soft skills needed for careers, but that is if the local school board deems them worthy of funding. Courses like graphic design, engineering, carpentry, computer science all require funding, and some school districts aren't willing to put up the costs to maintain these programs in favore of basic core curriculum.</article>

        <article class="a-counsel">Even if a student makes it into a high paying career, their ability to maintain that position is partly determined by how well they can manage their finances. On average, adults in the U.S. can only answer 50% of the <a href="https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-P-Fin-Index-report-TIAA-Institute-GFLEC-April-2021.pdf?x95483">P-Fin index</a>questions corectly, while 20% demonstrated an extremely low profiency in finances with scores of 25% or less. These people were likely not introduced to these concepts at a young age, and believe the remedy to this situation starts with education.</article>

        <article class="a-aftsch">While our primary focus is during school, students have limited agency in their schedules, and can only fit these programs into their day outside of school hours. Our after school program offers an additional window in which students can use our program and curriculum, as well as allow a safe environment on the grounds of their campus.<p><a href="#">Enroll today</a></p></article>
